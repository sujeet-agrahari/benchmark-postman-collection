# benchmark-postman-collection

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This is a tiny app that uses postman-collection.json file and benchmarks all the api with configured settings.

### Usage

  - replace `.json` file with your own `postman-collection.json` file
  - refactor code in `index.js` as per your collection strcture (mainly arrays and looping)
